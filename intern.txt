Subject: Request for Assistance with Internship Certificat

Dear Professor Gupta,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Rinav Hansa, and I am an Btech Computer Science student (not from your university). I am reaching out to you with a humble request for assistance, as I find myself in a difficult situation and believe your guidance could make a significant difference.

Recently, I completed an internship, but due to a misunderstanding (I missed a single email from the professor overseeing the internship), I was unable to obtain the certificate. It was an honest mistake, but it has left me in a tough spot. I now urgently need an internship certificate for my academics, and I’m unsure where to turn.

While I understand that we haven’t worked together directly, I’ve heard so much about your kindness and willingness to support students. I was wondering if there’s any way you could help me by issuing an internship certificate or guiding me on how to proceed in this situation. I’m more than willing to contribute to any ongoing projects, complete assignments, or provide any documentation you might need to make this possible.

I know this is an unusual request, and I truly appreciate you taking the time to consider it. Your help would mean the world to me and would go a long way in easing the stress I’m currently facing.

Thank you so much for your understanding and support, Professor Gupta. I look forward to hearing from you.

Warm regards,
Rinav Hansa
